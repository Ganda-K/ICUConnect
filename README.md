# ICUConnect

## üìå Description

**ICUConnect** is a Flask-based web dashboard designed to coordinate ICU bed availability across public hospitals in Kenya. It integrates machine learning to predict ICU occupancy and facilitates hospital-to-hospital referrals, enhancing real-time visibility into ICU resources.

**NOTE:**

You will be able to sign up, but login is restricted to verified users only due to ethical considerations around sensitive hospital data.

### Model Notebook

he machine learning model notebook can be found in

```
notebook/Predict_Occupancy_fixed.ipynb
```

It includes:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Feature Engineering

- A baseline ARIMA model to forecast ICU occupancy

- Evaluation metrics including RMSE, MSE, MAE, and R¬≤ score

The dataset used is publicly available from the Ontario Open Data portal:

## Deployment Plan

### Phase 1- MVP(local Deployment)

- Run the Flask app locally

- Use SQLite as local database

- Manual updates of ICU bed records.

### Phase 2 - Cloud Deployment(Planned)

- Host on Render or similar cloud platform

- Use PostgreSQl for database management

- Deploy and integrate trained ML model

- Secure access and user role management
